When to use Abstract Class?
1. Basically it provides implementation of base class to derived class
2. In case, if we need to use non-public members
3. If we want to add new methods in future, then abstract class is better choice
4. If we need to use multiple versions of the components
5. If we want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of our
 component, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow us to partially implement our class,
 whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.

General Tips:
1) In general, "implements" used for implementing an interface but "extends :" used fo extension of
a base class behaviour or abstract class behaviour to derived class.
